# Thinking Machines Lab

Thinking Machines Lab is an independent research group focused on scalable oversight and red-teaming for advanced AI systems such as Claude 3.5+. We develop behavioral benchmarks and adversarial test suites to study misalignment in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

思维机器实验室专注于对前沿人工智能系统（如 Claude 3.5+）的可扩展监督与红队测试。我们构建用于识别多轮推理偏差的行为评估工具与对抗性任务集。

## Current Work

- Multi-agent long-context evaluations for agentic behavior
- Prompt injection & adversarial compliance benchmarks
- Integration with METR-style eval frameworks
